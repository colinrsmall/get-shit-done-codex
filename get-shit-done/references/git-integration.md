<core_principle>

**Commit outcomes, not process.**

The git log should read like a changelog of what shipped, not a diary of planning activity.

**Guardrail:** Only create commits when the user explicitly requests or approves them in the current session.
</core_principle>

| Event                   | Commit? | Why                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| BRIEF + ROADMAP created | NO      | Planning artifacts are not committed             |
| PLAN.md created         | NO      | Planning artifacts are not committed             |
| RESEARCH.md created     | NO      | Planning artifacts are not committed             |
| DISCOVERY.md created    | NO      | Planning artifacts are not committed             |
| **Task completed**      | YES*    | Atomic unit of work (1 commit per task if requested) |
| **Plan completed**      | NO      | Planning artifacts are not committed             |
| Handoff created         | NO      | Planning artifacts are not committed             |

*Only if the user requested commits, and only for code changes.

<git_check>

```bash
[ -d .git ] && echo "GIT_EXISTS" || echo "NO_GIT"
```

If NO_GIT: Run `git init` silently. GSD projects always get their own repo.
</git_check>

<commit_formats>

<format name="task-completion">
## Task Completion (During Plan Execution)

If commits are requested, each task gets its own commit immediately after completion.

```
{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-name}

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat` - New feature/functionality
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `test` - Test-only (TDD RED phase)
- `refactor` - Code cleanup (TDD REFACTOR phase)
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `chore` - Dependencies, config, tooling

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard task
git add src/api/auth.ts src/types/user.ts
git commit -m "feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint

- POST /auth/register validates email and password
- Checks for duplicate users
- Returns JWT token on success
"

# TDD task - RED phase
git add src/__tests__/jwt.test.ts
git commit -m "test(07-02): add failing test for JWT generation

- Tests token contains user ID claim
- Tests token expires in 1 hour
- Tests signature verification
"

# TDD task - GREEN phase
git add src/utils/jwt.ts
git commit -m "feat(07-02): implement JWT generation

- Uses jose library for signing
- Includes user ID and expiry claims
- Signs with HS256 algorithm
"
```

</format>

</commit_formats>

<anti_patterns>

**Still don't commit (intermediate artifacts):**
- PLAN.md creation (planning artifacts are not committed)
- RESEARCH.md (intermediate)
- DISCOVERY.md (intermediate)
- Minor planning tweaks
- "Fixed typo in roadmap"

**Do commit (outcomes):**
- Each task completion (feat/fix/test/refactor)

**Key principle:** Commit working code and shipped outcomes, not planning process.

</anti_patterns>

## Why Per-Task Commits?

**Context engineering for AI:**
- Git history becomes primary context source for future assistant sessions
- `git log --grep="{phase}-{plan}"` shows all work for a plan
- `git diff <hash>^..<hash>` shows exact changes per task
- Less reliance on parsing SUMMARY.md = more context for actual work

**Failure recovery:**
- Task 1 committed ✅, Task 2 failed ❌
- Assistant in next session: sees task 1 complete, can retry task 2
- Can revert to the last successful task with a user-approved git operation

**Debugging:**
- `git bisect` finds exact failing task, not just failing plan
- `git blame` traces line to specific task context
- Each commit is independently revertable

**Observability:**
- Solo developer + assistant workflow benefits from granular attribution
- Atomic commits are git best practice
- "Commit noise" irrelevant when consumer is the assistant, not humans
